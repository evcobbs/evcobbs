What am I up to?
My first experience programming involved making ✨ beautiful ✨ Myspace pages with HTML and CSS. Thanks Tom. My favorite thing to do nowadays is create small Python projects to build strong fundamental skills. I would like to learn more about Javascript and APIs to make fun apps, websites, games, whatever. I also begrudingly try to keep my Java skills intact.
